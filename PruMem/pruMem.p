// This program uploads data sent from the other PRU into DDR3 memory
// This waits for r8 to be set and transfers the chunk of data over.

//
// The output ring buffer:
// First 4 bytes: (RingBuffer Tail + 1) If there was roll over, this is the RingBuffer Head
// Next 4 Bytes: Number of times rolled over
// Rest: Ring buffer Data
//
// Shared Registers (Sent through XOUT/XIN): 
// r7: Set to STOP_CMD to indicate to pruMem that processing has finished.
// r8: Set to DATA_AVAILABLE to indicate to pruMem that new data is available
// r9 to rXX (maximum up to r29): Sample data to send over
//
// Internal Registers (Registers not shared):
// r0: Address to PRU_DATA_RAM where the DDR3 memory address is passed in
// r1: DDR3 memory address
// r2: DDR3 memory SIZE (NOTE: We assume this is 8MB here)
// r3: Current address to write data
// r4: Number of bytes until we have to reset the ringBuffer tail
// r5: Number of times we wrote around the ring buffer
// r6: RingBuffer Tail
// 
// ASIDE: r4 and r5 is necessary because PRU only can do 8-bit ADD, COMPARE, and SUBTRACT
